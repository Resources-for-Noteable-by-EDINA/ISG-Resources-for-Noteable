    "Starting a new language is not easy, as you Duolingo fans know. No matter the activity or task around it, there is an element of taking in new information and making sense out of it that is challenging. Below are some terms to help make sense of the Python programming language before you make use of it. \n",

    "The Python Random module is a built-in module for generating random integers in Python. These are sort of fake random numbers which do not possess true randomness. We can therefore use this module to generate random numbers, display a random item for a list or string, and so on.\n",

    "In Python, a variable is a named container that can hold a value. It is like a storage location in the computer's memory where you can store and manipulate data.\n",
