# WaC- Resources-for-Noteable
Welcome to your Noteable presentation Github page! This repository contains Jupyter notebook files for a presentation to the Website and Communications section in ISG, University of Edinburgh. In this presentation, the speaker will discuss various topics related to data analysis, visualization, and programming using Python and R.

## Welcome to our Jupyter Notebook Service
We are excited to introduce our team to this Jupyter Notebook service that allows you to run and edit Jupyter notebooks directly from your web browser. Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

## Introduction to Python and R Languages
Python is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in various fields such as data science, web development, and scientific computing. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and easy-to-learn syntax. It is an interpreted language that allows developers to write code quickly and test it immediately.

R is another popular language that is widely used in data analysis and statistical computing. R is an open-source language that provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques for data analysis. R has a vast library of packages that provide tools for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

_Simple Script_

To help you get started with Python and R, we have provided a simple script that demonstrates some of the basic features of both languages. This script is intended to be fun and engaging, allowing you to experiment with code and see how the languages work.

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a new Jupyter notebook in your web browser.
2. Copy and paste the following code into a new code cell:

Copy code
## Python

print("Hello, World!")


Copy code
## R
print("Hello, World!")

Run the code cell to see the output "Hello, World!" displayed on the screen.

Try modifying the code to print a different message or changing the language to the other language provided above.

We hope you enjoy experimenting with Python and R and exploring the many possibilities that Jupyter Notebook service can offer to our team. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team for support.
