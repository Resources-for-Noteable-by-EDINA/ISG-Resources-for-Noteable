    "In this activity, we'll build a simple Mad Libs game where users can input their own words to create a silly (but still good!) story. \n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like a simple activity, but it slices right into the core of what computational thinking is: \n",
    "*a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and using algorithmic thinking to solve them using computers or other digital devices.*\n",
    "By combining mad libs with Python, you are combining the everyday English language you are used to with the recipe-building that defines computer programming, giving meaning to the overall outcome by defining what your ingredients, or variables, are. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Introduction to terms and learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experience a few... challenges in this workbook that will challenge you to think more like a computer does, rather than your intuition does. Computers work according to the rules they are bound by, and cannot find creative solutions to problems (much) yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the next steps of the activity, you will see a story template being defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is adding your user input, and here you will come across your first challenge. Don't worry though, there is assistance available! \n",
    "\n",
    "As you go along, you will notice the curly braces {} are used in Python to define a dictionary. A dictionary is a data structure that maps one value to another - kind of like how an English dictionary maps a word to its definition. In this case, we are mapping the mad libs words into the story using this dictionary. \n",
